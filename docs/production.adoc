[[overview]]
== Overview

The details of every production deployment are unique to the hosting Kubernetes cluster and the requirements for that deployment. As such, it is difficult to provide detailed instructions that match your needs. You are strongly encouraged to contact InetSoft support to determine the best way to design your deployment. This document provides general guidelines about the requirements for a production deployment.
